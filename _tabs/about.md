Hi, I'm m0rgan — a Marine Corps veteran, former 911 operator, and now a full-time web application security student and bug bounty hunter.

I’ve submitted over 20 vulnerability reports to public bounty programs, built automation tools for recon and exploitation, and work daily on scripting, lab work, and report writing. This site is where I share that journey — tools, lessons, and progress — all in one place.

If you're hiring in offensive security or AppSec: I’m actively looking for opportunities, and this site is my resume in motion.
