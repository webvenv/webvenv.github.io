Hi, Iâ€™m m0rgan.

After 15 years in roles where discretion and operational security were a way of lifeâ€”first in the Marine Corps, then as a federal police officer and 911 dispatcherâ€”Iâ€™ve shifted my focus to something thatâ€™s always fascinated me: web application security.

I donâ€™t come from a traditional tech background. I didnâ€™t get a computer science degree, and I didnâ€™t start coding when I was a kid. I completed labs every day. I read books. I built tools, submitted bug bounty reports, and I created this site to document what Iâ€™ve learned and to make things easier for the next person who decides to walk this path.

### Tools Iâ€™ve Built

- [**Musthave Cookies**](https://github.com/webvenv/musthave-cookies) â€“ CLI tool that identifies which cookies are actually required by the server to maintain session state, access authenticated resources, or avoid redirection/denial responses.

- [**Overflow Encoder**](https://github.com/webvenv/overflow-encoder) â€“ Payload construction utility to assist with exploiting Unicode Overflow vulnerabilities in web applications.

### Certifications

- **CompTIA Security+**

- **PentesterLab Badges:** Unix, Essential, Recon, White, PCAP, HTTP, Serial, and API

---

### What Iâ€™m Working Toward

Iâ€™m actively pursuing a role in **Web Application Security**.  
Whether itâ€™s testing, analysis, or secure development, my focus is on understanding how web apps break and how to make them safer.
